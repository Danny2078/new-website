            Welcome to the Home of Football
            <p> We provide daily information on squad news, transfer rumours.
                </p>
            <p>
                Jude Bellingham is likely to be one of the most sought-after talents in the transfer window next year. 

                The Borussia Dortmund and England midfielder is having one of his best seasons to date in Germany and a breakthrough World Cup at international level could see his suitors multiply. 

                Sky Sports senior reporter Melissa Reddy has been analysing Bellingham's future in recent days and has identified three main clubs after his signature.
                Jude Bellingham: Will Real Madrid or Premier League club win race for Borussia Dortmund midfielder?

                Sky Sports

                Real Madrid feel they are leading the race for the 19-year-old, but the reigning Champions League winners are fearful of the threat from the Premier League.

                Real feel Manchester City could come calling for Bellingham, with Pep Guardiola an outspoken fan of the English midfielder.

                Liverpool have also done the most research in terms of Bellingham's future and are in dire need of a refresh in midfield.

                What we want to know from you is - where should Bellingham move next, if he is to leave Dortmund next year? Which out of the three clubs should he pick? Or are there any other potential options for him - Chelsea? Manchester United? Bayern Munich?

                West Brom appoint Brunt as loans manager

                West Brom have appointed former midfielder Chris Brunt as the club's loans manager.

                The Baggies said Brunt "will work alongside first-team, recruitment and academy staff to nurture young players during their spells away from The Hawthorns."

                "The key role will see Brunt travel the length and breadth of the country to provide advice and support to players out on loan, observing training and games, before returning to The Hawthorns with progress reports," a statement added.

                Brunt said: “I’m delighted to take on a role that will help to continue the development of the young players I have been working alongside over the last 18 months."

                Brunt played over 400 times for West Brom during a 13-year spell at the club.

                Mikel Arteta has guided Arsenal into a position where they have become Manchester City’s biggest threat for the Premier League title. 

                The Gunners are currently sat at the top of the Premier League table after 12 games, 2 points ahead of the reigning champions.

                Arteta’s men are playing amazing football and look every bit like title challengers but many have questions about their squad as a whole and whether they are ready to achieve the feat.

                A signing or two in January could be the difference and Arteta has given Arsenal fans what they want to hear with his recent comments about the upcoming window.
